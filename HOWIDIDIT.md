# How I did it?

## Introduction

After reading the documentation to carry out the test, I have considered how to do it. Several ideas have crossed my mind. In the end I decided to do it progressively. I will start very simply and quickly to implement all the functionalities. Next, we'll add complexity to it.

### Step 1: run + framework

As a first step, I have decided to use a framework that helps me develop the main features quickly. I have chosen [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x) as it's the framework I've used the most.

Also, the latest versions of laravel includes [sail](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/sail). Sail is a package that provides a basic development environment.
